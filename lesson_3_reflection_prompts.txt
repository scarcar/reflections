When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  - when working with a team and want to share files with rest of team.
  
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- safer, anyone can make changes to GitHub (if public).  Before updating you local file (working files) need to verify changes are acceptable.  Need to do this manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

- forks allow you to get another repository to your own github account.  Allows you to make changes to it, without affecting the original repository.
- clone copies one repository.  If you make changes to it, you can copy those changes to the original repository.
- branches allows you to deviate from the master branch within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  - you can compare the differences and merge them off-line.
